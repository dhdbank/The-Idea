DhdBank is a decentralized health data storage bank that would provide decentralized electronic storage for health data and records, using end-to-end data encryption. These encrypted health data would be stored on a node network and can be managed and retrieved by the client or authorized user anytime within the storage contract duration.  

Instead of owning a storage cloud, DhdBank would provide cheap, efficient and operational data storage by creating a blockchain where node owners/ validators use computing space to store data securely, making DhdBank ’the Airbnb of Health Data Storage’. Check out our white paper for more information https://dhdbank.yolasite.com/ws/media-library/08ada9b4601244388a371d80ca9ef798/dhdbank-whitepaper.pdf 

DhdBank would change the health system.
