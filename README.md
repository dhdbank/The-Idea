DhdBank is a decentralized health data storage bank that would provide decentralized electronic storage for health data and records, using end-to-end data encryption. These encrypted health data would be stored on a node network and can be managed and retrieved by the client or authorized user anytime within the storage contract duration.  

Instead of owning a storage cloud, DhdBank would provide cheap, efficient and operational data storage by creating a blockchain where node owners/ validators use computing space to store data securely, making DhdBank ’the Airbnb of Health Data Storage’. DhdBank would change the global health data storage system and improve health care tremendously.

## KEY FEATURES

### Decentralized Storage

Traditional  and Centralized health data storage companies have a central point which can fail, resulting in a system breakdown and client health data loss. With its decentralized database engine, DhdBank would safely store encrypted client health data in fragments over the network without any central point of failure.

### Scalability

Proof-of-Work protocols are relatively slow, expensive, unscalable and environmentally unfriendly. DhdBank would use the Cosmos Tendermint  BFT consensus engine to power its Delegated Proof-of-Stake protocol.


### Usability

Most block chain Dapps are complex and difficult to use, preventing real world adoption. Using the Cosmos SDK, DhdBank Dapps would be user friendly with an easy-to-use interface.


### Cost Efficient

Traditional health data storage companies have very expensive data storage subscription plan. This would be replaced by very inexpensive and affordable storage subscription packages using DhdBank.
